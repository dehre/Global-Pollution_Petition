  <h4 class="description-main">By 2050, our oceans will have more plastic trash than fish. Itâ€™s shameful. Half of the plastic made we use just once and throw out, choking our seas and all the animals in it.</h4>
  <p class="description-sub">But in days, our governments can stem this tide when they meet at a historic summit to outline their clean ocean commitments. Public pressure just got #2 polluter Indonesia to commit to a 70% reduction in plastic waste! Now we need to go after the other top polluters. If one million of us get behind a global call the Head of the UN Environment Programme will announce our petition from the summit podium and work with us to push countries to ban single-use plastics and let our oceans breathe again. Add your name.</p>
